# Quote of the Day

Welcome to the **Quote** of the Day project! Inspired by a similar service available on Telegram, this web application delivers a new inspirational quote every day. Consider it as a little sign for your day, offering wisdom and motivation whenever you visit the page.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode and concurrently starts both the server and the client.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the client code.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run client`

Runs the client app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the client code.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the server.
The server will start on http://localhost:3001.


### `npm run build`

Builds the client app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.


### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.


### `npm run eject`
## Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Project Structure

The project consists of a client application built with React and a server built with Express. The server provides a new quote each day from a predefined array of quotes.

### Running the Application
  
    Start both client and server: npm start
    Start client only: npm run client
    Start server only: npm run server
